# Ahkam Ul Quran: A Unique Tafsir by Imam Abu Bakr Jassas
 
Ahkam Ul Quran is a tafsir (exegesis) of the Quran that focuses on the legal rulings derived from the verses. It was written by Imam Abu Bakr Ahmad bin Ali al-Razi al-Jassas, a prominent Hanafi scholar of the fourth century AH. The book is considered one of the most authoritative sources of Hanafi jurisprudence and a valuable contribution to the science of tafsir.

The book consists of five volumes, covering the entire Quran. In each volume, Imam Jassas explains the verses that contain legal implications, such as commands, prohibitions, stories, parables, oaths, etc. He also discusses the linguistic, grammatical, rhetorical and contextual aspects of the verses, as well as the opinions of other scholars and jurists. He often cites the hadiths (traditions) of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and his companions that support or clarify the meanings of the verses. He also refutes the arguments of those who disagree with him or hold deviant views.
 
The book is written in a clear and eloquent Arabic style, with a logical and coherent structure. It is rich in knowledge and insight, and demonstrates Imam Jassas's mastery of various Islamic sciences, such as tafsir, fiqh (jurisprudence), usul al-fiqh (principles of jurisprudence), kalam (theology), nahw (grammar), balagha (rhetoric), etc. It is also a testimony to his piety and devotion to the Quran.
 
The book has been translated into Urdu by Maulana Abdul Qayyum, who has done a commendable job of rendering the original text into an accessible and accurate language. The Urdu translation consists of six thick volumes, which are available online for free download at [https://archive.org/details/AhkamUlQuran\_Jasaas](https://archive.org/details/AhkamUlQuran_Jasaas) [^2^]. The original Arabic text can also be found online at [https://archive.org/details/Jassas001AhkamalquranJasasVol1](https://archive.org/details/Jassas001AhkamalquranJasasVol1) [^3^].
 
Ahkam Ul Quran is a treasure trove of Islamic knowledge and wisdom that deserves to be studied and appreciated by all Muslims who are interested in understanding and applying the Quran in their lives. It is also a valuable resource for scholars and students of tafsir and fiqh who want to learn from one of the greatest imams of Islam.
  
One of the distinctive features of Ahkam Ul Quran is that it deals with both the apparent and the hidden meanings of the verses. Imam Jassas explains the literal and the figurative meanings of the words and phrases, as well as the implied and the inferred meanings of the sentences and the contexts. He also distinguishes between the general and the specific, the absolute and the conditional, the abrogated and the abrogating, and the clear and the ambiguous verses. He shows how to reconcile the apparent contradictions and resolve the apparent conflicts between different verses or sources of Islamic law.
 
Another remarkable feature of Ahkam Ul Quran is that it covers a wide range of topics and issues related to Islamic law and ethics. Imam Jassas discusses matters of worship, transactions, family, inheritance, criminal law, international law, politics, economics, social justice, human rights, etc. He also addresses some of the contemporary issues that were relevant to his time and place, such as sectarianism, rebellion, apostasy, innovation, etc. He provides evidence and arguments for his views and judgments, and refutes the objections and doubts raised by his opponents.
 
A third notable feature of Ahkam Ul Quran is that it reflects Imam Jassas's deep love and reverence for the Quran. He constantly praises and glorifies the Quran as the word of Allah, the source of guidance, the criterion of truth, the miracle of eloquence, etc. He also urges his readers to recite, understand, memorize, act upon and propagate the Quran. He warns them against neglecting, misinterpreting, distorting or rejecting any part of the Quran. He also encourages them to seek Allah's help and mercy in their quest for knowledge and piety.
